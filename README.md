## Comparing Average Home Values with Google Trend Data

People do research before they make purchases, especially when they plan to purchase a home. By looking at the volume of certain Google searches over time, it may be possible to use these search trends to predict the appreciation rates of homes in certain areas. To explore this, the notebook above compares the median home value of a specified area and the search volume of queries associated with that area's real estate market (ex. "houses for sale in Buffalo, NY")

Search trend data is retrieved using Pytrends, an unofficial Google Trends API, and median home values come from a csv file downloaded from Realtor.com.

This project is not complete, I would like to create a predictive model with this data.
